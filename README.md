Logistic Model Predicting the Probability an Underdog Team Covers the Spread in a NFL Game

Group Project: Jackson Hubbard, Peter Holmes, Lavonne Hoang

This model performed very well on two different test data sets. If you use the model to bet on every game, the model is correct about 55% of the time on average. However, if you use the model to bet intelligently, such as only betting on games with predicted probabilities of the underdog team covering the spread greater than a threshold such as 0.6 or lower than a threshold such as 0.4, the model performs much better. Using betting thresholds such as these, the model predicted the outcome correctly up to 65% of the time. This is a very good result, as the Vegas spread odds are set in such a way to put the odds of a cover as close to 50% as possible. Thus, using our model, it is possible to make a profit in the long run.
